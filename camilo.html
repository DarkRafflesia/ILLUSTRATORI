            <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks<br>for itself. Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic<br>design and painting.
            <br><br><br>Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the<br>use of curiosity,” he explains. In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic<br>design projects in “a more commercial way”.
            <br><br><br>However, within illustration, he described his main motivation as, “to be able to generate a<br>communication method based on simplicity and synthesis, with few tools and colours. I am<br>interested in identifying people's behaviour, portraying activities, intimate moments, body<br>gestures, disfiguring objects and reducing the amount of detail in a composition.”
            <br><br><br>Camilo is fascinated by everyday scenes, moments and personal habits, often depicting scenic bus<br>routes, art galleries and public figures in his own psychedelically shaped style. “Within my work I<br>try to reproduce real moments from an innocent and impartial perspective.”</p>
