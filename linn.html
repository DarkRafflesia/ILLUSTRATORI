            <p>Swedish illustrator, designer and animator Linn Fritz lives and works in London where she creates<br>charmingly clean, precise imagery in a trademark pastel palette for a wide range of editorial and<br>commercial clients.
                <br><br><br>Her neat, fluid line work was honed during her time at Hyper Island, a time which Linn cites as<br>“hands down one of the best experiences” of her life.
                <br><br><br>“My Hyper Island journey completely changed me as a person.” she says, “It pushed me to work<br>harder and gave me the tools to succeed in the real world.” The progressive nature of Hyper Island<br>led Linn to abandon pen and paper and concentrate on what digital could offer her already well-<br>honed drawings. As she puts it, “There's more freedom drawing digitally, and more room for<br>mistakes.”
                <br><br><br>Alongside her editorial and commercial projects, Linn is the co-founder of Panimation, “a<br>community of equality-driven women, trans and non-binary friends aiming to connect and<br>support each other within the animation industry.” Some of her favorite projects often orbit<br>around her interests of “feminism, clothes, plants and interior” but Linn also looks for a good<br>client relationship, one with trust and creative freedom.</p>
